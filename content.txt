Django also provides an optional administrative interface that is generated dynamically through and configured via admin models. Some well-known sites that use Django include , , , , and . History [ ] Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the at the newspaper, and , began using Python to build applications. was hired early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended.

Features [ ] Components [ ] Screenshot of the Django admin interface for modifying a user account Despite having its own nomenclature, such as naming the generating the responses "views", the core Django framework can be seen as an architecture. It consists of an (ORM) that mediates between (defined as Python classes) and a (" odel"), a system for processing HTTP requests with a (" iew"), and a -based dispatcher (" ontroller"). Also included in the core framework are: a lightweight and standalone for development and testing a form and validation system that can translate between forms and values suitable for storage in the database a template system that utilizes the concept of borrowed from object-oriented programming a framework that can use any of several cache methods support for classes that can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions an internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals an system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages a system that can produce and read and/or representations of Django model instances a system for extending the capabilities of the template engine an interface to Python's built-in framework Bundled applications [ ] The main Django distribution also bundles a number of applications in its "contrib" package, including: an extensible authentication system the dynamic administrative interface tools for generating and syndication feeds a "Sites" framework that allows one Django installation to run multiple websites, each with their own content and applications tools for generating built-in mitigation for , , , and other typical web attacks, most of them turned on by default a framework for creating applications Extensibility [ ] This section . Please improve this section by adding . Find sources: – ( January 2015 ) ( ) Django's configuration system allows third party code to be plugged into a regular project, provided that it follows the reusable app conventions. More than 5000 packages are available to extend the framework's original behavior, providing solutions to issues the original tool didn't tackle: registration, search, provision and consumption, , etc. This extensibility is, however, mitigated by internal components' dependencies. While the Django philosophy implies loose coupling, the template filters and tags assume one engine implementation, and both the auth and admin bundled applications require the use of the internal . None of these filters or bundled apps are mandatory to run a Django project, but reusable apps tend to depend on them, encouraging developers to keep using the official stack in order to benefit fully from the apps ecosystem. Server arrangements [ ] Django can be run in conjunction with , using , , or using flup (a Python module). Django also includes the ability to launch a server, enabling use behind any web server which supports FastCGI, such as or . It is also possible to use other -compliant web servers.

In this case django-jython must be installed in order to provide drivers for database connectivity, which also can provide functionality to compile Django in to a .war suitable for deployment. Version history [ ] The Django team will occasionally designate certain releases to be "long-term support" (LTS) releases. LTS releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time, typically 3+ years, regardless of the pace of releases afterwards.

Ports to other languages [ ] Programmers have ported Django's template engine design from Python to other languages, providing decent cross-platform support. Some of these options are more direct ports; others, though inspired by Django and retaining its concepts, take the liberty to deviate from Django's design: Liquid for Template::Swig for for and for ErlyDTL for CMSs based on Django Framework [ ] Django as a framework is capable of building a complete , however there are dedicated CMS projects which are built upon and extend the .
