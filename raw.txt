The mission development construct is defined by four umbrella programs.
</p>, <p>The Explorer program derives its origin from the earliest days of the U.S. Space program. In current form, the program consists of three classes of systems - , , and  missions. The NASA Explorer program office provides frequent flight opportunities for moderate cost innovative solutions from the heliophysics and astrophysics science areas. The Small Explorer missions are required to limit cost to NASA to below $150M (2022 dollars). Medium class explorer missions have typically involved NASA cost caps of $350M. The Explorer program office is based at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-204"></sup>
</p>, <p>The NASA Discovery program develops and delivers robotic spacecraft solutions in the planetary science domain.

Primary objectives include Solar System exploration employing medium class spacecraft missions to conduct high-science-return investigations. New Frontiers builds on the development approach employed by the Discovery program but provides for higher cost caps and schedule durations than are available with Discovery. Cost caps vary by opportunity; recent missions have been awarded based on a defined cap of $1 Billion.
